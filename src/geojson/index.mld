{1 GeoJson}

The GeoJson library provides a functor {! Make} for building a GeoJson parsing
and manipulating module. You just need to provide a Json parser using tools like
[Ezjsonm] or [Yojson].

{i Before diving in, it is important to note that if you are dealing with gigabytes
   of data in GeoJson format you would be better served by the [Geojsonm] library which
   provides functions using the [Jsonm] streaming parser to avoid loading everything
   in memory}.

{2 Providing a Json Parser}

Before getting a Geojson library you first must provide a parser implementation. {! Geojson} doesn't
depend on a particular Json parsing library (there are quite a few in the OCaml universe). This modularity 
comes with a small cost, you must provide a simple parsing module to the {! Geojson.Make} functor.

{3 Ezjsonm Parser}

The following is an example of such a parser. If you can you would be better checking the tests and benchmarks
{{: https://github.com/patricoferris/ocaml-geojson} of this library} for an up to date, type-checked and building version.

{[
module Ezjsonm_parser = struct
  type t = Ezjsonm.value

  let catch_err f v =
    try Ok (f v) with Ezjsonm.Parse_error (_, s) -> Error (`Msg s)

  let find_opt t path =
    try Some (Ezjsonm.find t path) with Not_found -> None

  let find = find_opt
  let to_string t = catch_err Ezjsonm.get_string t
  let string = Ezjsonm.string
  let to_float t = catch_err Ezjsonm.get_float t
  let float = Ezjsonm.float
  let to_list f t = catch_err (Ezjsonm.get_list f) t
  let list f t = Ezjsonm.list f t
  let to_array f t = Result.map Array.of_list @@ to_list f t
  let array f t = list f (Array.to_list t)
  let obj = Ezjsonm.dict
  let null = `Null
  let is_null = function `Null -> true | _ -> false
end
]}

{2 Using the Library}

{3 Reading Geojson}

Once you have provided the Json parser, you can then start using the library properly.
The simplest way to get started is first reading Json into your choosen parsers internal
representation and calling {! Geojson.S.of_json}.

Sticking with the [Ezjsonm] example we can do

{[
module G = Geojson.Make(Ezjsonm_parser)

let geojson_of_string s = 
  let json = Ezjsonm.value_from_string s in
    match G.of_json json with 
      | Ok v -> v
      | Error (`Msg m) -> failwith m
]}

{3 Manipulating and Accessing Geojson}

Imagine you wished to access all the [properties] fields in your GeoJson document. There are two 
ways they can appear -- either as part of a single, toplevel {! Geojson.S.Feature} object or as 
a list of features inside {! Geojson.S.Feature.Collection}. Here's one way you could go about this:

{[
let get_all_props s = 
  let json = Ezjsonm.value_from_string s in
  let geo = G.of_json json in
  match geo with 
    | Ok (Feature f) -> Option.to_list @@ G.Feature.properties f 
    | Ok (FeatureCollection fc) -> 
      let fs = G.Feature.Collection.features fc in
      List.filter_map G.Feature.properties fs 
    | _ -> []
]}
